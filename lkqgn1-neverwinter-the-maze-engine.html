                            <p> Update 5:35PM: Scott and Lindsay had an a-MAZE-ing time answering your questions. I'll (Andy) continue answering any questions that I can and for ones that I can't, I'll send it over to Scott and Lindsay to be posted later. Thanks, guys! Well met, adventurers! With the announcement of our next expansion for Neverwinter, we've decided to hold a Reddit AMA! Feel free to ask any questions about Neverwinter: The Maze Engine in this thread and we'll begin answering them at 4:30PM PT. Entering. Hey everyone the maze engine just released on xbox one so I am doing a lets play of the story quests. check it out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjZpS3iqlw0. gt Hi Adventurers, gt gt Over the past months, our team has taken several actions to combat botting in Neverwinter. One aspect that several players have identified as needing to be addressed is that of skill nodes. Based on community feedback, and in our continued effort to take action against botting, we are removing refinement item drops from skill nodes. gt gt Because these items are important to players, we did not want to remove them outright. Instead, they will be more availab. Hey I know I dont have much activity here on reddit but I really enjoy the community and I'm serious, I ascended to the PCMR and barely play my xbox anymore. It makes me sad and I would like her to go to a good home that will play her more than I do. Thanks guys. PRICE: 0 shipped (willing to look at other offers and or trades if they're reasonable) TIMESTAMP: Here I have a Xbox One Elite console WITHOUT the Elite controller, instead I have a master chief special. 
https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter/news/detail/9770373 A small excerpt for those at work: "With Neverwinter: The Maze Engine, we are bringing back four of the favorites. Each of these dungeons has had both a visual and design pass to bring them up to the quality people expect. We’re also bringing back Castle Never as a revamped, higher-tier dungeon. It’s got a new look, new fights and a new story." Also hints there about a new artifact and new mounts system. This is a quick summary thread based on posts made by others. If you have tested any of these and can confirm/deny then please do so! LoMM: bugged but can allegedly be completed ReQ: all broken and/or unable to be completed? RiQ: demo broken, tiamat broken again it seems, todg increased damage, MPF damage excessive and/or stats capped too much, nothing new on others RLQ: dungeons fine? Skirms fine? Expeditions and undermountain zones: fine? Maze engine campaign and weekly: fine but still. No mention of the Cannot Claim ANY Heroic Encounter Rewards due to the "You Already Have All the Items in this Package" bug. I'd like to do a Straw Poll: Barovia is no longer affected by item level scaling. (Castle Ravenloft is still scaled.) Maze Engine, as well as other affected content, should no longer have enemies spawn at levels significantly higher than the player. In places that scale item level and character level, the player's item level is no longer scaled down more than expec. I just started getting back into neverwinter after a while (I stopped around storm kings thunder) and I’m feeling overwhelmed, chult is way to hard ravenloft and heart of fire seem to Grindy and the new profession system is alien to me and I’m wondering what to do first and what gear I should get. My item level is around 10k and The only campaigns I’ve finished are maze engine, underdark and I’m close to the end of ice wind storm kings and tyranny. I’m a trickster rouge. I had put neverwinter down for about two years, picked it back up about 3 months ago. Anywho, I can't get back to Mantol Derith to finish the Maze Engine campaign. Drizzt isn't in Driftwood Tavern and there's no option to travel to it when you leave Protectors Enclave so.how the heck do I get back there? amp#x200B; Help would be much appreciated here. amp#x200B; \--Resolved-- I'm an idiot. I can in fact travel to the Underdark and then to Mantol Derith. Thanks Limmo for pointing. 
Hey, guys. I've recently started playing neverwinter on the xbox and now I'm running through all the campaigns to get the boons. On the maze engine campaign, I've completed the "Aid Bruenor Battlehammer" quest, but I don't have enough tales of adventure to complete repel demons. I've read that you should get them from daily quests that Bruenor gives, but he has none for me, so I can't really start chapter 4. How do I get them to proceed in the campaign? amp#x200B. With Mod 15 being released in roughly 6 weeks from now on consoles, what are u going to do to prep optimal for the release of it (what would u wish u would have known)? amp#x200B; Let me kick off with: amp#x200B; Buy extra char slots (while its on sale), to utilize/maximize the rewards from the Neverember's Recruitment Event ( https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter/news/detail/11012733-developer-blog%3A-neverember%27s-recruitment-event (https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/never. Created a brand new toon yesterday morning after patch. I have not received any of these rewards yet: Adventurer's XP Booster Embroidered Bag of Holding Stone of Health Trained Grizzly rare mount 3 Insignia Choice Packs Barbarian Shaman rare companion 3 Rank 7 Bonding Runestones 100,000 50% Bonus Rough Astral Diamonds booster Runic Bag of Holding Maze Engine Signet of Patronage https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter/news/detail/11012733 I hit level 10 last night 
# Who Needs This Guide As the title says, frustrated players who are relatively new to the game, but also long time players who still don't get late game content. There are many fantastic guides already available, but they tend to be either for players who have no MMO experience at all, or specific guides on late game content for players who already have extensive technical knowledge of game specifics already. Anything about reaching the late game content tends to be built for the MMO noobs. So I've been playing for a bit more than 2 weeks now. I hit a bit over 11k gear score with some solid dps stats on my DO DC. I am currently working on my bonding runestones, just got my first one to R10. I also finished Sharandar and just need to grind out the mats to get the boons now, similarly progressing swiftly in Underdark, Dread Ring, Maze Engine and have finished Elemental Evil. I still cant run the 11k roulette without pissing off the others, but I can clear everything https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter/news/detail/11012733 Copy/Paste: Hear Ye, Hear Ye! Lord Neverember has sent messengers far and wide to recruit worthy adventures to travel to Neverwinter and aid the kingdom in its future endeavors. For those who heed the call, honor, fame, and treasure awaits. The Heart of Fire module brings with it our new Neverember’s Recruitment event. Any new characters who log in during this event will earn extra rewards while leveling as well as Neverember. Hello, Last night (https://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/94qiam/best_legendary_mount_for_control_wizard/) everyone convinced me to not get the legendary mount for now. but as for what I should work on next, I'm still a bit up in the air. I guess my big questions are: What campaign should I focus on next? What will get me the biggest bang for my buck? Is there an easy way to export my build? ('cause this kinda sucked. lol) Anyway, without further ado, my Build I haven't played Neverwinter in a good while and my brother's been bugging me to return as well. Last time I played, Mod 9 (The Maze Engine) had released, so I've missed quite a bit. I originally played a Human GWF and had been working on a Dragonborn OP. Is there a QuikNotes version of things to look out for in the new content? What old items are no longer used and safe to crunch down in to the swirly green Refinement Points? I mostly solo played (never really been in a guild) 
So I absolutely loved the base game of Neverwinter, and elemental evil was awesome. However after that, the dragons one, icewind dale, maze engine. They don't work the same. Instead of "do this cool quest, then go do this cool quest, then watch this cutscene, then go do this cool quest" it's more like "do this 3 quests, watch this cutscene, okay now do those 3 quests for a month, then you can do 3 more." Is.is that how they all are going to be? I have not tried the chult or river distric. </p>
