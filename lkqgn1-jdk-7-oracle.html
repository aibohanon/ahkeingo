                            <p> Call me odd but I really like the C# language (even on Linux). IMHO, it is much more evolved and sophisticated than its cousin Java (which is less used and also marred by the "Oracle vs Google" litigation these days). With so many popular apps like Pinta, KeePass, Banshee, Tomboy, nant, etc. already used on linux, its probably time for even hard-core Stallmanists to admit that .NET probably has a very bright future for Linux desktops? Coming to the topic, now that two competing versions I am a Linux noob and got my first raspberry pi yesterday. Unifi doesn't want to work. I have a static IP and nothing else uses that port. The log: ltUniFigt ERROR system - exec error, rc=141, cmdline= /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-8-oracle-arm32-vfp-hflt/jre/bin/java, -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8, -Djava.awt.headless=true, -Dapple.awt.UIElement=true, -Xmx1024M, -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError, -XX:+CrashOnOutOfMemoryError, -XX:ErrorFile=/usr/lib/unifi/logs/hs_err_pid%p.log, -jar, /usr/lib/unifi/lib/ace.jar Wondering if anyone else has seen this or discovered a work around? I've been using the com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl package for JDBC calls in a fairly large project. When I switched the JDK from Oracle JDK 8 to OpenJDK 11, the only issue is this package. Any advice for workarounds? I'm porting code from this original project to a new project that uses OpenJDK 11, so the reusability of this functionality would be essential. As I won't be using any ORMs etc., just JDBC (or JDBCTemplate. Hello I had previously installed a jdk 8 and jdk 11 a couple months ago off ninite when i got my pc, they were openJDK version. I decided to delete both versions and opt for the versions on oracle instead which is where my mistake begins. I realized after deleting them that I cannot download the jdk off oracle without an account and was only able to actually download 12. I downloaded 12 and was unable to even open eclipse anymore so I went back to ninite and installed jdk again 
I am installing the latest Raspbian Stretch Lite (Version April 19 2019) and latest Airsonic WAR (v10.2.1) on my RPi2 from scratch. I manually installed the latest Java 8 JDK from Oracle (jdk-8u212-linux-arm32-vfp-hflt.tar.gz) and verified it working.

Xpath I noticed that Java 11 only ships with a jdk, not a standalone JRE. For end users that run older Java programs that likely will never be updated to use the new jdk, does Oracle plan to support JRE 8 with security patches indefinitely? I would think they'd want to keep the major version in-line with the jdk.

So I want to write a java application that I might want to sell in the future. For development I need a development kit. For the Oracle JDK, if I understand it correctly, I need a special license to get updates after the end of the support period. What exactly does that mean? I never updated my jdk before. Are they distributed in a separate channel or are they applied automatically to the newest version of a jdk that oracle offers to download? Meaning if I go and download The reasoning being if you type "free", generally you will be advertised to or get the LITE version which will only have some of the functionality and then will be up-sold to. Open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. This has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers. Just a quick preface: if your using openjdk this does not apply to you, but may still be of interest. I know most mod authors and players use Oracle Java when playing Minecraft. The reason is simple, its the default when you go to the official java website. The version distributed on the java website is not the only version in-fact its not even the "reference implementation", the reference implementation is the opensource OpenJDK. The Oracle version takes the opensource version, adds a bunch. Is it possible? There are some termux repositories in github, but I'd like to hear your opinion.

So long as Mojang stays with deploying a Java 8 version of the JRE there shouldn't be much problem, except they won't be able to use any features that were brought out in later versions of Java. If they decide to use Java 11, will they then support OpenJDK so that they don't have to pay the licensing fee to deploy the JRE? I'm pretty curious because I had some experience trying to get minecraft to run on OpenJDK on linux, and it never worked. Thanks to all of you who have engaged with the /r/jboss community so far.

Hello everyone, We are considering changing our JDK's from OracleJDK to OpenJDK. I know most of the web says they are nearly identical, OpenJDK is a reference implementation , even Brian Goretz (Java Language Architect) says this : "Oracle JDK and OpenJDK are almost identical. Most of the JDK distributions are forks from OpenJDK with different bug fixes and backports applied. So the difference between the distributions now is largely which bug fixes are picked up." However Hi everyone! I am looking into buying a new laptop, which would be the first computer I buy since teaching myself how to program over the past year. In the process of learning to program, I have really done a number on my current laptop. This thing is a trooper but it's definitely time to put her down to rest. I have multiple versions of MySQL installed in different places somehow, MongoDB is installed locally somewhere, I also have MAMP running one version of PHP which I toggle Hi. I'm a Java developer, who prefers to work using IntelliJ while my colleagues are stuck with NetBeans. I often mock them for not having this or that feature, being unable to do something faster or do it at all, but one thing they do have at me is the hotswap functionality. While Idea can hotswap changes in method bodies and not much of anything else, NetBeans are able of hotswapping method signature changes, method additions and deletions and stuff like that, while being an IDE 10 years. I am attempting to download the JDK off Oracle's website however I keep getting this message : Sorry!

I've also tried. Hi. Years ago I wrote a javafx application in Java 7. I want to write a new App using FXML that I can comfortably develop, run and debug from IntelliJ, if possible including hotcodereplacment. Now with Java 11 it seems that I have to use openjdk because of the licensing change of Oracle, but openjfx doesn't seem to support fxmls (read: I can't geht FxmlLoader into the classpath). Should i go back and use java 8? Can/should I use jdk by Oracle without paying? Something else I am missing. ### Introduction Java and the JVM (Java's virtual machine) are required for many kinds of software, including Tomcat, Jetty, Glassfish, Cassandra and Jenkins and Data Center Europe (https://www.mivocloud.com/contact-us).

You'll then select the version you wish to use for your projects. Hey guys, has anyone tried playing Minecraft in Ubuntu on the Pocket? The issue I'm seeing is the mouse cursor will not stay in the window, it causes a rapid spinning of the player which prevents looking around. I'm unsure if this is more Linux in general as I've not seen this problem on other PCs running it. I've tried both OpenJDK and Oracle Java runtimes but the effect is the same.
