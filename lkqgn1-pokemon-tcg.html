The Pokemon online client is very modern, fluent and could even be competition for Hearthstone. It motivates to continue playing and the system where you get a code for every booster/deck you buy in reality, and with that code you get the same thing online really encourages purchases.

I was frustrated with a lack of easy to use places to quickly save decklists and print them out for tournaments so I set out to create my own solution. I have pricing data integrated with TCGPlayer to make it easy to get accurate up to date pricing. amp#x200B; I have a lot more planned.

Practice against the computer I used to play competitive TCG when I was little, quite a bit. I had the most success with Storefront Gengar in the SP era but I still played during BW and won small tourneys with Landorus Terrakion. But then high school and college happened and I haven't really played since besides some TCG Online in the past couple of days. I'm thinking about getting back into it. What are some of the big topics I need to learn about before I do so? Does rotation still happen at the same time every year?.
