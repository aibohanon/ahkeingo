Configure your network settings to use Google Public DNS.  /96 prefix, you can use Google Public DNS64 instead of Google Public DNS IPv6 addresses, providing connectivity to IPv4-only services without any other configuration. I'm using Pi-hole as my DHCP server which is successfully sending out its IPv4 address as a DNS server. However, I also see two IPv6 DNS servers on my devices that are coming from Google Fiber. Is there any way to disable this or force the Pi-hole to send its v6 address out? It's annoying to manually configure DNS on each device and impossible for some (ex: Xbox). Hi, Google Public DNS users, Google Public DNS is now also available to IPv6 users. Although it has always been possible. 
Backstory: ISP with all customers running Dual-Stack, 10% of customer traffic is IPv6 Currently we have our customer DHCPv4 Pool set up to use our DNS Resolvers but do not have our DHCPv6 pools pointed to us, they are pointing to Google’s. The latency delta between the two are around 10ms. I know that not all of the customers devices are using IPv6 (Smart TVs or older hardware) but has anyone tested out the latency impact on the preferential treatment of IPv6 based on DNS alone? I’m working. Google Public DNS is a free, global Domain Name System (DNS) resolution service, that you can use as an alternative to your current DNS provider. Hi, I'm currently on (UK) Virgin Media, who I think are due to move to IPv6 just after hell freezes over. I'm moving house though, and will be on a BT line, so think that I'll be able to get an IPv6 enabled connection. Is it a given that you will get a static address if your ISP is v6 enabled? Or are there still reasons why they would lease you a potentially changing address? I still find IPv6 confusing compared to v4, so I'm not quite sure how the publicly routable aspect relates to IP addre. 
ДНС-серверы 8.8.8.8 и 8.8.4.4 — это публичные серверы DNS от Google (Google Public DNS) . Помимо IP-адресов TCP/IPv4, публичные DNS-серверы Google имеют ещё So I've been using Google's Public DNS address (8.8.8.8) for the last several years, but recently my I've discovered that my iPhone has been ignoring it. This is quite peculiar because my computer is still using Google's Public DNS properly, but no matter what I do I can't seem to get my iPhone to use 8.8.8.8 anymore, instead it always seems to use my ISP's default DNS. I've been reading up on the internet that its something about having to use "DNS over HTTPS"  Service. Google Public DNS operates recursive name servers for public use at the IP addresses 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 for IPv4 service, and 2001:4860:4860::8888 and 2001:4860:4860::8844, for IPv6 access. 
I just got Google WiFi and it's working pretty well so far. But I'm wondering what you guys think the best settings configurations are - for example I was thinking of changing dns to cloudflare but it said that would disable dns rebinding protection? Is that important? And would y'all recommend using the ipv6? If anyone has any other advice too I'd appreciate. We occasionally recommend people switch to using Google's public DNS resolvers. Here are some of the reasons why and how you can make that change. Recently noticed that some websites take longer to start loading when I'm on Wifi compared to LTE. amp#x200B; Using Reddit for example, it may take 1 second to start loading the webpage if I'm on my phone using LTE, but if I'm loading it with the same device on wifi it may take 3-4 seconds to start loading. However, once the loading started wifi is faster than LTE. amp#x200B; LTE is T-Mobile 4G LTE, and Wifi is Comcast cable, connected to a cable modem then Netgear wifi router. Google collects statistics about IPv6 adoption in the Internet on an ongoing basis. We hope that publishing this information will help Internet providers, website owners, and policy makers as the industry rolls I've been trying to troubleshoot this for the past 2 days, I've tried so many things and I'm just tired and need help now. First, a short description of my whole network: I get service from 2 different ISPs. 1. ADSL on a TP-Link router (I connect to this via wifi) 2. Mikrotik SXT 5HnD (https://mikrotik.com/product/RBSXT) (Wireless P2P AP) to a D-Link router via ethernet and that's connected to my PC via an ethernet cable I have access to both TP-Link and D-Link routers You can set a custom IPv6 DNS server in the Google Wifi app. Google Wifi feature behavior with IPv6 IPv6 reachability testing. To ensure a robust IPv6 connection, Google Wifi periodically runs connectivity tests in the background. In June 2012, an owner of a Samsung Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.0.2 opened a case (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36949085) in Google's Issue Tracker requesting support for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6, otherwise known as DHCPv6, or RFC 3315, which allows for stateful address and connection configuration on devices joining an IPv6 network. DHCPv6, like DHCPv4, is commonly used in enterprise networks for connecting devices. For the last six years — including through. Dynamic DNS allows you to direct your domain or a subdomain to a resource that is behind a gateway that has a dynamically assigned IP address. To use dynamic DNS with Google Domains 
Edit: In my limited understanding of Anycast services I would assume longer prefixes than /48 could be inside of service provider networks where Google potentially has DNS servers setup. Given the two Google IPv6 DNS addresses: 2001:4860:4860::8888 2001:4860:4860::8844 It seems odd to me that what should (?) be operationally distinct addresses are in the same /48 (ultimately the same /32,/48,/64, etc.) which is what I understand to be the longest prefix that is globally routable. Given. Search the world's information, including webpages, images, videos and more. Google has many special features to help you find exactly what you're looking. I'm not sure why they have started doing this, but over the past few weeks, iiNet has started redirecting all DNS requests to their own DNS servers. I see no legitimate reason why they would do this. Does anyone know a way to stop this short of using DNS over https? Edit: thanks to u/bnetimeslovesreddit for pointing out that it was just the fact that IPv6 DNS was not set on my end so it was taking priority and resolving to iiNet. This is my bad for jumping to conclusions. Looks like your connection isn't ready for IPv6. This may be due to problems with your home router, operating system With the new Australian bans being implemented, i've heard people say that switching your DNS to 1.1.1.1 (https://1.1.1.1) is much safer and private as well as a little faster. Should I do change my router's DNS to 1.1.1.1. dns da google: ipv4: 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 ipv6: 2001:4860:4860::8888 2001:4860:4860::8844. 
Hi there! I just jumped on the pfSense thing and I had successfully started it on an ESXi VM (intel i7 NUC). My VDSL comes with VLAN ID 2, successfully passing through my Draytek 130 and Edgerouter X, this one is only set up as Vlan Aware switch. I have one single problem: I can ping any valid IP from my clients, but can only resolve some domains. For example, I can’t open Netgate.com, or Reddit, while I can open YouTube or Dslreports.

We're going to show you how to edit your Network Connections DNS Servers. Hi, this is my fourth post on this subreddit about ongoing intermittent issues with my Internet service. I previously had multiple conversations in DMs with employees in this subreddit about my packet loss, and at the time most of the issues seemed to subside after a while, and the last time it happened there seemed to be work being done in the area so in the end I never had anyone come out to check out my node specifically to check if there was any noise. The main issue I am having is packet. 
Để đối DNS trên Windows 10 Fall Creators bạn phải vào Settings. Vậy cách thiếp lập DNS Google IPv4 và IPv6 trên Windows 10 Fall Creators như thế. So recently I was sent onsite to one of our clients to install a new virtual host server along side an existing SBS server, with the plan of doing a physical to virtual conversion remotely over the weekend. In order to get the new server on the network, I had to install a 5-port switch, disconnect the existing server, then reconnect it through the switch. I expected it to go smoothly, maybe a minute of downtime, but I was wrong. The exchange server wouldn’t come back online, EMC reported faile. In this documentation, we can check how to configure your network settings to use Google public DNS. Google Public DNS IP addresses are the following: IPV4: 8.8.8.8 8.8.8.4 IPV6: 2001:4860:4860::8888 2001:4860:4860::8844 Change DNS Server Settings: ( Please save your current IP address somewhere.

Самые быстрые и надёжные публичные ДНС сервера в России I'm currently using an Intel NUC with a single network interface as a router-on-a-stick. I'm using firewall rules to pass specific local IP's out explicitly via OpenVPN, using Mullvad as a provider. This part seems to work fine, no webRTC or DNS leaks, and the unmarked IP's come out normally. However, these unmarked IP's seem to occasionally have DNS resolution problems. Timing out sporadically, but then coming back after a few minutes/refreshes. Other webpages working fine during the period.

I've looked at a few topics on this. I want to block Chromecast-enabled devices from using Google DNS. I've tried a couple of solutions but it doesn't seem to be working correctly. I want to only block Chromecast devices from those DNS IP's and have them use/redirect to a custom set of DNS IP's of my choice. Does anyone know of a solution that works.

Thanks.

Finally . testing it now. I wish GWiFi would stop with the "periodic IPv6 testing", though (or allow us to turn that off) as it gives false negatives on Comcast, which completely supports IPv6 in my area, but for some reason will drop IPv6 (no RAs) from time-to-time, requiring me to toggle the "IPv6" switch Google Cloud DNS documentation Publish your domain names using Google's infrastructure for production-quality, high-volume DNS services. Google's global network of anycast name servers provide reliable, low-latency authoritative name lookups for your domains from anywhere in the world. Last week Spectrum supposedly did some maintenance in my area (that's what the automated message said when I called after my internet went down). Ever since that night, I've been experiencing DNS issues. My speed is perfectly fine and hasn't changed, but it takes around 30 seconds to a minute to get to any website, I'm not having any problems streaming video, and I get the usual "resolving host" message on Chrome (the sign that it's a DNS issue), and the same on Firefox.
