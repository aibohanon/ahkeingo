                            <p>Hey guys! I don't know if there's anyone around here or if anyone would be interested in it, but I thought I'd kick off a thread for the hp 1030 with some stuff I found helpful while setting up the gently used 1030 I picked up off ebay. Now that the laptop is reasonably priced in the used market, it'd be cool to have a little community. I will update this thread with more links and tips, and update if I run into any problems, but if there any other 1030 redditors out there Hey guys! I recently went through the process of trying out a few laptops in the 500$ range, and have been using the HP 1030 for the last few weeks. Now that I've had a few weeks to get a feel for the laptop, I thought I'd share my notes. In the last few years I've daily drove a long list of laptops, from the Dell M1530 to the Thinkpad T410, x220, x240, L440, and the Dell e7240, e7250, e7470, 7280, Macbook Pro 2016 13", and Acer Chromebook 14. Apart from the Elitebook 840 G2, I'd previously. Hey, Im trying to get my old Dell XPS M1530 to work again, but it is having trouble connecting to the internet. It seems that it is missing its network driver, how would i go about reinstalling one? Its freshly wiped by the way, and its still on windows vista. Help would be appreciated. Hey all, hope you're well. Windows keeps pinging me with available updates for a printer I don't have. - HP driver update for HP LaserJet M1530 MFP Series PCL 6. When I click to update, it instantly says it's up to date, without download/install time. When I look in Update History, the print update I just executed isn't there at all. I've checked in Device Manager - this printer isn't there. How can I get it to stop asking me for updates about this issue? Specs: - Windows Recently installed linux mint 18 on my old Dell XPS m1530 (https://www.cnet.com/products/dell-xps-m1530/specs/) laptop. Absolutely loving it so far, but I've been noticing that its getting really hot. Is there a way to check how fast is the fan running or if its running at all? And can I control it? Installed the Nvidia driver for the inbuilt 8600m GT graphics card over the default intel graphics card. Could this be an issue. Hi I have a dell XPS m1530 and was working fine till windows 10 did a update now I have a static Noise coming from the left speaker if I mute the sound it goes away and it is not there until I turn on the laptop and I get to the part where it shows the circle loading the Operating system can anyone help with what this maybe as I am at a dead end here and the sound is driving me crazy when playing music lol PS The windows update said it was to help protect me when online nothing about driver. 
Sorry for the x-post, I just poked around and realized you're probably better people to ask. There's a small, nameless icon on my desktop that I can move but not delete. ( It's unclickable, too. It keeps disappearing and reappearing. Looks like a cell phone or something. I'm running Windows Vista on a Dell XPS m1530 that's about 3 years old. I use AVG Free and haven't really had any problems with the laptop before. Edit #2: The mystery icon disappeared. I just received a used laptop from a friend and I am trying to figure out how to completely erase all the data. I have no cd that came with it. How can I backup all the drivers and restore the computer's operating system after erasing it? System Specs: Machine name: HOBEY-PC Operating System: Windows Vista™ Business (6.0, Build 6001) Service Pack 1 (6001.vistasp1_gdr.101014-0432) Language: English (Regional Setting: English) System Manufacturer: Dell Inc. System Model: XPS M1530. i have a dell xps m1530 i currently have windows 8 so i can get windows 10 am i going to be able to up grade or will the drivers not be able to work if that is an issue would i be able to just buy a keyboard and mouse SOLVED See comments I had a torrid time recently trying to install the correct Nvidia packages for Debian Jessie / Testing. It went down like this; Fresh install add non-free and contrib to my sources list. Use nvidia-detect to suggest a nvidia package. Install the suggested nvidia-driver package. Use nvidia-xconfig to write a config file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf Reboot as suggested. This resulted in a blinking cursor after startup. time to debug; Check /var/log/Xor. 
I'm trying to get a friend into the game so we can play together but so far he hasn't been able to get it to run smoothly enough to play getting only around 10 FPS. In single player ARMA 2 he gets about 45 FPS, I'm not sure what I should be trying to change at this point. He plays on all lowest settings right now. Specs below, thanks in advance for your many advices. -------------- System Manufacturer: Dell Inc. Model: XPS M1530 Total amount of system memory: Hello, So I am going to do a clean install of windows 7, as the title says. My laptop is a Dell XPS M1530. I have all the discs that came with my computer, such as drivers for the camera, and various other hardware. Some things I'm sure I can find an updated version online for, but others, such as my webcam I'm not so sure of. My question is whether or not I should expect any compatibility issues by upgrading to a 64 bit version of windows 7 with the dell drivers from when my computer had vista. I'm having an issue with outbound sound going through my soundcard. I'm running Windows 7 and I have a Sigmatel Audio card (I think). The issue is that people on the recieving end of the sound (via skype, ventrilo, etc) are hearing a repetitive, high pitched beeping noise. I don't hear it, but they do, through multiple microphones and programs. I haven't been able to find a W7 driver to try to update, so I was hoping someone might have other ideas / know where to find the driver. The system. Hey All, Trying to fix HDMI Audio on Linux Mint 15 on a older Dell XPS M1530. Right now the HDMI video works but no audio device appears when HDMI is in use and therefore I get no sound. Did some googling found an audio driver I'd like to try but having difficulty installing it. The package no longer is released in a .deb file only a .dsc and a tar.gz (https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-audio-dev/+archive/alsa-daily/+packages) But the standard source installation procedure Hopefully you guys can help me as i am in a very frustrating position with my DELL XPS M1530 It originally came installed with Windows Vista, however after a few months i grew tired of it and then decided to upgrade to windows 7. I want to do a clean install of windows vista again because so many drivers are incompatible with windows 7 on my dell, like my bluetooth radio, and my firewire port (for a audio interface) Anyway i popped my Vista disk in and installed windows vista from Windows. I'm using a Dell XPS M1530, wireless card is Dell WLAN 1395 Mini-Card. On windows 7, 64-bit. I have power settings at high performance, and under wireless adapter in power settings, that is also at high performance.Anyways, I can connect to wireless perfectly fine, but when I try to connect to an ethernet, it stops my wireless connection. I was trying to create an ad-hoc network, but when I go to add, under manage wireless networks, it says unexpected error, and diagnosing gives the error. 
Because the screen is missing, what you'd get here is essentially a portable desktop . In return, I would want a regular desktop with similar specifications. I've got a Dell XPS M1530 (screenless) laptop, though a lot of its parts have been replaced. Currently, it has: Intel Core 2 Duo T7250 @ 2.00GHz 4 GB of RAM NVidia GeForce 8600M GT video card 150GB HDD space It has a fingerprint reader (though I haven't found a Windows 7 driver for it, I do know from when I had Vista My roommates and I pay for ~20mb/s download speed. They're averaging around 18-20 while I can't get past values like 2 or 3 mb/s. What's the deal? I'm guessing it's something with my laptop or wireless driver, but how do I go about fixing it. Apologies if I'm completely getting these terms wrong, or if I'm wrong altogether. I'm on a Dell XPS M1530 with windows vista. Thanks in Advance. Good day fellow redditors, I'm asking for your help to solve this annoyance or to point me towards the correct reddit/place to submit it. Basically, my touchpad has gone mad. It clicks itself when I'm typing. I have checked and it is not a case of me touching it accidentally. I have tried with all the sensitivity settings way down and way up. It just seems to happen randomly while I type. I think it might be caused by vibration, dirt, not sure. The first time I noticed it was right after. Can anybody help please I recently installed Windows 7 on my laptop and have one device still not configured in the system. It says its a base system device properties say PCI bus 3, device 9, function 3. I'm unsure of what driver to get. I'm on a Dell XPS M1530 Thanks. I have had a Dell XPS M1530 laptop for many years and never had any issues until today. The display is behaving very strangely. Sometimes on start up nothing will display until I wait for windows to load and then close and reopen the screen. When I do this it will only display on part of the screen and I cannot change the resolution without issues. Here is an album ( of the mentioned issues. The first pic is after I reopen the screen. The second picture I'm having an issue with my laptop graphics. Every time I run two flash videos/programs or a flash video/program and something else (in my case World of Warcraft), my screen flickers quickly then goes black for a second or so, then comes back to life with the error message shown in the title. When it comes back, the flash video that was playing has lost video (now shows only green), but audio still works. The occurrence rate seems to go up when anything is full-screened, if that matters. So this is the second time it's happened in five days. I'll just be on the internet, usually with music playing from youtube and a couple of other tabs, and then the mouse will freeze. The music will keep playing for another thirty seconds or so, before the computer shifts to a blue screen (noooooo), and restarts on its own. Microsoft says that it's a driver issue with the graphics card, a NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT. But I've checked the drivers, they're updated. The last time this happened. </p>
