The Windows 10 Anniversary Update is now upon us, and with it we have gathered plenty of useful resources go along. In this first of two threads, we have for your browsing pleasure a guide to what’s new with the Anniversary Update, a guide for some frequently asked questions and common problems, and a guide to cover common misconceptions and confusions with Windows 10 and upgrading from Windows TLDR: If you aren't running Windows 10 (and even if you are), make sure you have updated at least to MS17-010 (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx), released in March 2017. If you're looking for the specific patch to install, the numbers are listed in parentheses in that link for each system. Edit: The April roll-up patches for the following OS should cover you as well. There was some confusion since MS now does roll-up patches. Windows 8.1 (all versions):. This one has me ticked off. So, day before yesterday, get a call from a customer, wants me to come out, says he has issues with aol mail. I ask him if he's using AOL's web site or if he's using the AOL Desktop software. He starts going onto a huge long rant "I'm not a computer guy, I like to "keep it simple stupid" " etc etc, so I schedule the appointment, thinking this is something simple like a login issue. He wants me to show up outside of normal business hours (open at 9, he wants 7am appoin. Long time ago I was doing freelance tech support on the side, you know the craigslist kind, when a call from one of my regular clients went a little weird. So this was a guy who just refused to listen to me when it came to protecting his computer from harm. I would tell him he needed x software, or enable y firefox addon (chrome wasn't a thing yet). He never did it. He always used to say he could just pay me to fix it. Meh whatever I can deal with that.

I have been switching between opera, microsoft edge, and chrome for the past few months and am trying to make up my mind on which one to use primarily. I loved using chrome on my older MacBook Pro because of the nice, smooth scrolling. When I upgraded to a dell xps 15 the scrolling in chrome compared to microsoft edge had a noticeable difference because of issues with microsoft's precision touchpads. Microso.

I've been lurking here for close to a year, learning from the threads here, as well as lots of googling and reading on other sites, in preparation for my first build. With the end of the year approaching the goal is to get it bought and built as soon as I've saved the rest of the money for it, i.e. by mid November. I've put some questions in the 'additional info' section at the bottom of the post. So, some backgro. This is a tale of a neighbour, her six-year-old laptop and a lot of malware. -------- My phone rang. It was my neighbour. gt the friendly neighbour: Hey, iwebnawebu, um, my laptop is running slow and I was wondering if you could, um, take a look at it? As I was bored and didn't really have anything to do, I answered: gt iwebnawebu: Sure, yeah, no problem. So, she brings her laptop over and it's an old HP Compaq 6720s . Bear in mind, this story is placed in 2013. Christmas is the time where you fix your relative's computers. Well, actually, there was nothing to fix. I just wanted to add my mother's laptop to our new wifi. I pictured it to be an easy task - grab the MAC address, write it into the filter, enter the wifi password and then close the lid and walk back into my room. At least so I thought. Type `ipconfig /all` and the wireless adapter is nowhere to be found. Wat? Let's check the control panel. Not there!? I know for sure that this laptop.

Hi, So I've had My XPS 15 FHD since November last year. Battery life has definitely not been 8 hours since I got it but it has been decent. But, recently I've been noticing that the battery is being increasingly bad, like only giving me 2 hours or so when I've had nothing else open except about 5-6 tabs on google chrome, and maybe messenger or a word document. I also run the bare minimum of extensions on chrome too. (Lastpass, Adblock, Great Suspender for suspending tabs and Telegram Web (mess. 
Can anyone explain why Firefox doesn't keep me logged in to Reddit and other sites when I restart the Windows 8.1 computer?

Toshiba Tecra A3-S611 I have a friend who just gave ~0 for it, and it came pre-installed with a not-genuine version of Windows 7 Pro, not to mention mismatched battery and AC adapter (both fit but the voltage is not the same).

Long story short, with all the kerfuffle over Fallout 4 I though it was time to go back and play 3 so that it was fresh in my mind in a few months. You know, for science. Should be noted that I haven't played Fallout 3 in a very long time. As in, I had to force myself to finish Zeta just after it came out.

My grandma has decided she wants to begin to learn how to use a computer. The last time she's used a computer was before the mouse was commonplace. We've set her up on an older Windows XP machine, and are in the process of getting her an internet connection. What is the best software I can use to minimize time spent on tech support? Here are my ideas so far: 1. Something like Faronics Deep Freeze to enable a simple restart to undo any potential damage done.
